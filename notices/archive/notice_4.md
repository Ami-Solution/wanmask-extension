Dear WanMask Users,

There have been several instances of high-profile legitimate websites such as BTC Manager and Games Workshop that have had their websites temporarily compromised. This involves showing a fake MetaMask window on the page asking for user's seed phrases. WanMask will never open itself in this way and users are encouraged to report these instances immediately to either [MetaMasks phishing blacklist](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues) or our support email at [support@wanmask.io](mailto:support@wanmask.io).

Please read MetaMasks full article on this ongoing issue at [https://medium.com/metamask/new-phishing-strategy-becoming-common-1b1123837168](https://medium.com/metamask/new-phishing-strategy-becoming-common-1b1123837168). 

WanMask is looking into ways to add our own phishing detection. For now we rely on the MetaMask blacklist.
